5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
The box model consists of several attributes that can be changed to alter the look of an element. The content is what you have in 
the middle of the box that the browser is displaying. This is usually text but can also be things like an image or embedded video. 
Then there is the padding, which acts as a buffer zone between the content and the border of the box. The border of the box is the 
edge of the box. Finally, the margin acts as a buffer zone between the element and the other elements around it. In order to make 
all of the elements respect their set width, we can use the box-sizing attribute, usually with the value 'border-box'.
